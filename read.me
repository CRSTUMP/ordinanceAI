#Welcome to OrdinanceAI!!!


##Introduction
This tools primary responsibility is to search the approved ordinances of Middletown, Delaware County PA using 
an open source RAG and LLM.


##Modes
There are 3 modes: search, conflict and missing.

###Search
Performs semantic search and returns a summarized version of the top 3 paragraphs related to the user input.

###Conflict
Performs semantic search and reviews the output for conflicting information.

###Missing
Performs semantics search and reviews the output for missing information.

##Known Issues
Observation 1 - The missing and conflict searches are very wordy.
Observation 2 - Latency negatively impacts the user experience - a product of using Llama3 as the LLM on my local.

##Example Queries
Semantic Search
print(chat_twp("How many chickens am I allowed to keep?"))

Conflict
print(chat_twp("What are the rules covering junk vehicles on my property?", mode = 'conflict'))

Missing
print(chat_twp("How do I build a warehouse that holds magic lamps?", mode = 'missing'))
